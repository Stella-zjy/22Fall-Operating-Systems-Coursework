Compilation rules in the Makefile:

make clean: remove all the files in obj/bin and all .txt files
make all: clean and run RR policy, MFQ policy, and IORR policy
make runrr: run tasks following RR policy (default quantum 4)
make runmfq: run tasks following RR policy (default quantum 3)
make runiorr: run tasks following IORR policy (default quantum 4)

Comments:

Outputs of Question1, 2, 3 will be saved in sched-run-RR.txt, sched-run-MFQ.txt and sched-run-IORR.txt, respectively.

Some modifications to the original files/functions:
1. os-scheduling.h 
    Add three attributes to struct task (Question3):
        unsigned int IOTime; 
        unsigned int IORate; 
        unsigned int cyclesInIO;
    to record the duration, frequency of I/O, and the current number of cycles spent to be suspended
2. sched-simulator.c
    Modify the section for reading tasks files in the main() function to accomodate for quantum input and features for I/O (Question1,2,3)
3. sched-policies.c
    Modify the admitNewTasks() function (Question1,2,3)
        // Initialize cyclesInQuantum to be zero
        tasks[i].cyclesInQuantum = 0; 
        // Initialize cyclesInIO to be zero (used for IORR)
        tasks[i].cyclesInIO = 0;
